# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to increase the speed at which our client Steve can analyze the entire stock market. Our previously submitted workbook enabled Steve to analyze a small subset of the stock market with relative efficiency. However, Steve may not have time to wait for our current code block to run through every possible stock option. Therefore, our goal for this project is to try and increase the speed of our macro by refactoring our code and comparing the time it takes to execute the new macro vs. the old macro.
